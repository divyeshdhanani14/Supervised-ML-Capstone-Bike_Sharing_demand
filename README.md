# Supervised-ML-Capstone-Bike_Sharing_demand

Research says!
Several bike/scooter rides sharing facilities have started up lately especially in
metropolitan cities like San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and one of
the most important problem from a business point of view is to predict the bike
demand on any particular day. While having excess bikes results in wastage of
resource (both with respect to bike maintenance and the land/bike stand required for

parking and security), having fewer bikes leads to revenue loss (ranging from a short-
term loss due to missing out on immediate customers to potential longer-term loss

due to loss in future customer base), Thus, having an estimate on the demands would
enable efficient functioning of these companies.
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining
membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations
throughout a city. Using these Bike Sharing systems, people rent a bike from one
location and return it to a different or same place on need basis. People can rent a
bike through membership (mostly regular users) or on demand basis (mostly casual
users). This process is controlled by a network of automated kiosk across the city.
Here, we forecasted bike rental demand of Bike sharing program in Seoul based on
historical usage patterns using supervised ML Regression.
We thoroughly understood the relationship between the variables leading us to focus
on generating the hypothesis followed by Data Exploration part.
This dataset contains approximately 8760 observations with 14 columns and a
combination of category and numerical variables.
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis based on Statistical, Market Based, Univariate,
Bivariate and Categorical analysis.

As said a data can be only converted into an information when molded from a
clustered form to a stack structured form
The Procedure counts in Steps of Importing the dataset and cleaning the data
viewing through the lens of statistical analysis and revising the dataset for further
analysis and gaining the inference to move further on Dataset Modelling.
Splitting the test | train data Dataset splits into these training, validation and test
dataset, weâ€™ll take the test data for analyzing
the performance of training data set and apply modelling to it.
We created machine learning models to predict for casual and registered users
separately and then combine them to generate the overall prediction for the counts.

Hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal
hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. By contrast, the values of other parameters
(typically node weights) are learned. To test different hyperparameter configurations
we used GridSearchCV for this configuration test.
The Models we tested are listed as below:
1. Linear Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. Elastic Net Regression
5. Random Forest
6. Gradient Boosting
7. Extreme Gradient Boosting
Concluding with shortlisting 3 models which worked precisely in this scenario were:
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting with 92%, 93%
and 95% accuracy rate and deployable.
